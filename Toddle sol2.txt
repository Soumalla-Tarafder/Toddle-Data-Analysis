KPIs:-- 

	1. total number of student , total staff  ratio

	2. total class , total learning experience ratio
	
	3. total announcement , total journal post ratio


Health Matrixes Calculation:-- 

	Here we have calculated the health matrix in 2 parts i.e.

	1. We have calculated the "health matrix" for the individual KPIs with respect to the 33 percentile data [0-33 percentile lies in "poor" category , 33-66 percentile 	data lies into "concerning" category and above 66 percentile lies between "excellent" category].

	2. Then we calculated the final "Health Matrix" using the individual KPIs "health matrix" i.e. [if all the 3 KPIs "health matrix" value is "poor" then the final 	"Health Matrix" value will be poor , if any of 2 KPIs "health matrix" value is "excellent" we consider the final "Health Matrix" value will be "excellent", otherwise 	the final "Health Matrix" value will be "concerning"].
